## Introduction
I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Information Technology, Polytechnic Insitute at Purdue University. I work with my advisor Prof. John A Springer at D.A.T.A Lab, while also collaborating with my committee member, Professor Justin Yang at DAO2 lab.

My primary research interests lie in Connected and Automated Vehicle (CAV), with regarding to its perception system, vehicular communciation system, and cybersecurity issue lies within the system. My recent reserach work focuses risk analysis of vehicular network and in-vehicular network, while I'm also working on some perception issues for CAV under severe weather and corner cases. 

Previously, I received a master degree in Mechanical Engineering Technology in 2016 in Purdue University. During my master study, I worked with Prof. Haiyan H Zhang on data analysis and control algorithms in mechantronics.
